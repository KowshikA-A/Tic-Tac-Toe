## Introduction

This Python program is a classic implementation of the beloved Tic-Tac-Toe game, brought to life with the Tkinter library for a user-friendly graphical interface. Whether you're new to programming or a seasoned developer, you'll enjoy the simplicity and fun of this game.

## Features

🖥️ **Interactive GUI:** The game boasts a sleek graphical user interface built with Tkinter, making it a visually appealing and engaging experience.

🔄 **Random First Player:** You won't always start as 'X'! The game randomly selects the first player ('X' or 'O') at the beginning of each match.

🏆 **Win Detection:** The program checks for a win condition after each move, alerting you when one player gets three symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

😅 **Tie Game:** If all cells are filled and no one wins, the game graciously declares a tie.

🔁 **Play Again:** After each game, you have the option to play another round without restarting the program.

📏 **Custom Board Size:** Tailor the game to your preference by choosing the number of rows and columns, with a maximum size of 16x16.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. When prompted, enter the number of rows and columns you'd like for your game board (remember, they must be equal and between 3 and 16).
3. Click on the empty cells to take turns with 'X' and 'O.'
4. The game will promptly announce the winner or declare a tie.
5. Decide whether you want to dive into another thrilling round!
